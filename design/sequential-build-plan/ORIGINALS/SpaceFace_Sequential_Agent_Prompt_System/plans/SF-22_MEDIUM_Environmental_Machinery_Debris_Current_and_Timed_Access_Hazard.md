<mission>
The recomposed sector contains one environmental machine and one moving/timed hazard that change trajectories or access, create a physical puzzle, and reveal valuable content without reducing to damage circles.
</mission>

<fresh_thread_context>
You are working in the live `coldshalamov/SpaceFace` repository. SpaceFace is a Three.js browser/Electron top-down space game with a fixed-timestep simulation, a flat serializable `GameState`, an event bus, registry-ordered systems, Rapier-dynamic physics behind a physics-authority membrane, Flight V3 as the default flight path, tactical AI as the default AI path, data-driven content, a DOM/CSS overlay UI, and browser/Electron launch parity.

The product direction is not “add more named content.” It is to turn SpaceFace’s broad but uneven systems into a coherent game whose signature is assisted relational physics, an inhabited world, and industrial transformation:

- the player chooses target, direction, risk, timing, and strategy;
- the flight computer supplies bounded precision, never hidden strategy;
- physical displacement, constraints, fields, collisions, components, routes, and persistent world changes create the interesting play;
- mining and automation build traversal, defense, logistics, sites, and world-changing infrastructure—not merely passive credits or a higher-DPS gun;
- content must be embodied through visible actors, structures, traffic, state changes, consequences, and normal player routes.

A repository snapshot taken on 2026-07-19 found that the live tree was already substantially ahead of the original planning conversation. At that snapshot:

- `master` included Atlas/map/travel work, a major graphics checkpoint, and an integrated graphics/performance checkpoint.
- Massline orbit telemetry, invariant vocabulary, target scoring, capture/attach plumbing, release ratings, reel/pump checks, arc data, whip impact, impulse-charge combinations, and other partial machinery existed.
- The live latch path was still largely cursor/ray dominated; turn-direction intent and pre-latch preview were not yet a complete player-facing acquisition grammar.
- Flight V3 increased tethered helm authority but did not yet prove a bounded radial/tangential orbit controller that reliably expresses “hold thrust plus turn to orbit.”
- The experimental G/trackpad mode still followed sampled world-space path points and was a known risk for flailing, mixed-reference-frame behavior.
- Graphics foundations, authored asset admission, Kestrel/RCS, Helios surfacing, representative geology, and typed combat/world visual identities had landed, but current natural-route, Electron, GPU, crowded-scene, and visual-family acceptance remained incomplete.
- The program documents could lag the actual branch. Live code, current checks, public-route evidence, and current git identity outrank this snapshot.

Treat every statement above as a lead to re-check, not as permission to assume it remains true.
</fresh_thread_context>

<authority_and_repo_safety>
Apply this authority order whenever sources disagree:

1. The user’s current instruction and this prompt’s bounded outcome.
2. Root `AGENTS.md` and the nearest nested `AGENTS.md` files governing touched paths.
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
4. `design/GDD_2_0.md`.
5. `design/program/NOW.md`, `design/program/README.md`, the active 113-packet roadmap, and the execution protocol.
6. The activated subsystem plan/spec and supporting planning packages.
7. Historical plans, transcripts, campaign material, old summaries, and this prompt’s dated snapshot.

Before editing, run or equivalent:

- `pwd`
- `git log -1 --oneline`
- `git status --short`
- `git diff -- <every candidate owner file>`
- `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/master...HEAD`
- inspect active worktrees/branches when relevant

Do not reset, restore, checkout, clean, stash, force-push, discard, overwrite, or “tidy” unrelated work. A branch name alone is not isolation. If the shared tree is dirty in an expected owner path and the prompt does not explicitly grant that path, stop editing that path, preserve the evidence, and continue only on independent work.

Do not edit compatibility implementations as a shortcut when the live route uses Flight V3, tactical AI, or Rapier-dynamic. Do not create a second writer for position, velocity, credits, cargo, reputation, derived stats, save normalization, input actions, registry order, or runtime asset identity.

Do not alter expected/golden data merely to make a check pass. A justified re-record is a separate, explicit product decision with before/after evidence.

Only the lead/status integrator edits `design/program/NOW.md`, global completion claims, the shared Git index, or shared-tree commits. Unless the user explicitly grants an isolated worktree and commit authority, return an uncommitted logical diff and receipt. This prompt system authorizes you to update only the current prompt file and its matching receipt inside this prompt-pack workflow.
</authority_and_repo_safety>

<engineering_invariants>
- Simulation uses the XZ plane, the fixed simulation timestep, `state.rng`, and `state.simTime`; no ambient simulation randomness or wall-clock decisions.
- Continuous forces and impulses route through physics authority. Do not directly assign live Rapier body transforms or velocity from gameplay systems.
- Browser, Electron, packaged builds, probes, and acceptance routes share one gameplay entrypoint, defaults, assets, and state semantics.
- Player-facing work is not complete because code/data/assets/tests exist. It must be reachable through the declared normal route, with current revision identity and current evidence.
- Persisted state uses stable IDs, bounded schemas, safe defaults, migration/normalization where required, and deterministic save/Continue behavior.
- Input assistance interprets probable intent and supplies precision; it must not choose the player’s strategy, aim weapons secretly, select a route, or play a maneuver as a kinematic animation.
- Manual override must be immediate and legible. Every controller has explicit reference frames, bounded outputs, deadbands/hysteresis where needed, and telemetry sufficient to diagnose disagreement between intent and actual motion.
- Visual identity, collision, targeting, interaction, and gameplay classification must agree. A beautiful structure around an unrelated central circle is a failed implementation.
- Performance work removes invisible work, allocations, duplicated passes, fragmented resources, and bad cadence. It may not pass by deleting authored content, reducing default quality, or lowering entity counts without an explicit product decision.
- Accessibility preserves critical information under reduced motion/flash, keyboard, mouse/trackpad, gamepad, text scale, focus, contrast, and non-color cues.
- Status terms remain distinct: `IMPLEMENTED`, `FOCUSED_GREEN`, `ROUTE_ACCEPTED`, `VISUALLY_ACCEPTED`, and `INTEGRATED` are not synonyms for “done.”

<agentic_work_style>
Do not stop after producing a plan. In this same run, perform the audit, establish the current baseline, implement the smallest coherent vertical slice, verify it in layers, inspect the entire intended diff, and return a receipt. Ask no question whose answer can be obtained from the repository, current checks, included reference material, or a bounded experiment.

Use the loop:

1. Gather current evidence.
2. Separate findings into `confirmed`, `inferred`, and `unknown`.
3. Re-prove the player/system gap before editing.
4. Establish a failing test, characterization, or same-framing visual baseline appropriate to the task.
5. Implement through existing authorities and ports.
6. Verify pure behavior, integration, save/determinism, public route, visual result, accessibility, and performance in proportion to risk.
7. Review the diff for foreign paths, duplicated ownership, hidden feature flags, stale fixtures, and placeholder substitutions.
8. Return exact commands, results, artifact paths, revision identity, limitations, and follow-ons.

If the requested outcome is already genuinely satisfied in the current tree, do not invent replacement scope. Prove the existing behavior, classify the prompt `ALREADY_SATISFIED`, document what made the dated premise obsolete, write the receipt, and move the prompt to review.

<problem>
Hazards often become colored radii that apply damage or status. That adds rule text but few new decisions. SpaceFace needs deterministic environmental machinery that interacts with fields, Massline, payloads, routes, and timing.
</problem>

<consequences_of_the_problem>
If this gap remains, later features will either duplicate weak abstractions, hide failure behind presentation, or make player input less trustworthy. Treat the causal problem above—not merely its visible symptom—as the unit of work.
</consequences_of_the_problem>

<why_this_is_cool_and_worth_building>
A debris current carrying objects through a periodically safe corridor, or a dormant alignment machine that changes the route when manipulated, gives the sector mystery and creates access gating from existing verbs rather than keys and menus.
</why_this_is_cool_and_worth_building>

<player_observable_checkpoint>
At the end of this prompt, a reviewer must be able to demonstrate this outcome through the declared route:

The recomposed sector contains one environmental machine and one moving/timed hazard that change trajectories or access, create a physical puzzle, and reveal valuable content without reducing to damage circles.

The checkpoint must be coherent and recoverable. It may leave later breadth for future prompts, but it may not leave the primary result as data-only, debug-only, UI-only, or default-off.

<mandatory_live_audit>
Before changing code, inspect the live owner paths, imports, registry order, feature flags/defaults, relevant dirty diffs, tests, public routes, save surface, and evidence. Classify each dated premise as `confirmed`, `partially-confirmed`, `obsolete`, `not-reproduced`, or `blocked`.

Use these research anchors as starting points, not brittle file instructions:
  <anchor>SF-12 field kernel, SF-19 site/recipe, SF-21 sector composition, current hazard/environment systems.</anchor>
  <anchor>Map/ledger/mission discovery and NPC job/traffic routing.</anchor>

Return a concise working audit containing:
- live owner and consumer map;
- what already exists and its highest proven status;
- exact missing primitive or player-route gap;
- path and semantic mutexes;
- baseline evidence;
- smallest coherent implementation boundary.

Then continue directly into implementation.

<verification_plan>
Verify in layers, retaining every failure and its classification:
1. New pure/unit/contract or characterization proof.
2. Owning subsystem aggregate.
3. Risk-triggered determinism, simulation compare, save/migration/Continue, launch, asset, UI/accessibility, and performance checks.
4. Normal browser route for every player-visible behavior.
5. Electron route when runtime, input, rendering, assets, save, or launch parity is relevant.
6. Current media and independent vision review when `VISION-YES` or `VISION-RECOMMENDED`.

<completion_and_file_movement_protocol>
This prompt is part of a sequential controller workflow.

At the start:
- Read `../README.md`, `../SEQUENCE_MATRIX.md`, `../WORKFLOW_AND_REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md`, and all receipts for declared dependencies.
- Confirm every dependency has a receipt whose state is at least the dependency’s required gate.
- If a dependency is absent, stale, contradicted by current code, or only “implemented” when this task requires route acceptance, record `BLOCKED_BY_DEPENDENCY` rather than silently compensating inside this task.

During work:
- Tick checklist items only when current evidence supports them.
- Write the machine-readable receipt at `receipts/SF-22.yaml`.
- Do not edit any other prompt file or another task’s receipt.
- Do not mark global roadmap packets complete; report mappings and evidence to the lead.

On successful completion or evidence-backed `ALREADY_SATISFIED`:
1. Update this file’s frontmatter `status` to `ready-for-review`.
2. Fill the completion record at the end of this file.
3. Move this exact prompt from `plans/` to `review/`, preserving its filename. Use `git mv` only when the prompt pack is tracked and the current worktree policy permits it; otherwise use an ordinary file move.
4. Leave the implementation diff and receipt ready for the reviewer/integrator.
5. Do not start the next prompt.

On a genuine blocker:
- Keep the prompt in `plans/`.
- Set status to `blocked`.
- Write a receipt naming the exact blocker, evidence, safe independent work completed, and the narrowest unblocking action.
