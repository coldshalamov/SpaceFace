# EC-S24 — Sedna Dark — A lit window at the edge is not a fuel pump

## Director's card — read this first

*From the creative director, 2026-11-09. The standard, the cast and the build order are in [09 — Creative direction](https://github.com/coldshalamov/SpaceFace/blob/experience-commissions/EC-G13-integration-director/design/program/experience-commissions/09_CREATIVE_DIRECTION.md). Where this card and the brief below disagree on **scope or order**, the card wins. On **ids, canon and who owns which state**, the brief wins.*

**One line:** the last lit window before the dark, kept by someone honest about what it cannot do.

**Landmark:** one lit window; beyond it, the dark rim and its wrecks. **Shift:** Senna reading out the names of the lost; the tanker rumor on the radio. **Toy:** lamp buoys — tow a chain of them out into the dark. They stay. Each trip pushes the lit world a little further.

**Faces:** **Dustwife Senna** (canon) — *"I can fix the hull. Not the planning."* · **Bodie**, survey and repair hand — *"How far? Then double it."* · The Question, through its existing gates.

**Argument:** go further, or get back. **Your mark:** your chain of lights into the dark.

**First 90 seconds:** one warm window, and past it nothing at all, and a list on the wall of what the post does not have.

**Build first (Slice 1):** Enough to Get Back. No hidden traps: the player always knows what is not on offer before they leave.

### How to build this town and check your own work

Work in this order. Each step ends with something you looked at.

1. **Look first.** Arrive by the ordinary route and capture what a stranger sees today (`node scripts/capture-sector-identity.mjs` covers Helios and Ceres; for other sectors copy it for yours until the `look` tool from EC-G17 exists). Write the five Stranger Test answers for the place *as it is now* in the PR. That is your "before".
2. **Build the toy alone**, in the no-boot simulation lab (`node scripts/agent-loop.mjs sim <scenario> --trace`), until it is fun with nothing else in the scene. The jobs lean on it.
3. **Then faces, then the shift, then your mark** — each through the system that already owns it (contacts, broadcasts, world records). Do not start a parallel one.
4. **After every step:** the one narrow test (`node --test test/<file>`), then `npm run test:fast`. Never run the full `npm run check` while something is red, and never use the long playthrough battery as a per-change check.
5. **Does it still boot and fly:** `node scripts/check-game-playable.mjs`.
6. **Did it cost frames:** `node scripts/check-hitch-budget.mjs --out=<file>` before and after, back to back in one sitting (this machine swings from 60 to 40 with background load, so a comparison across sessions means nothing).
7. **Stranger Test:** give a fresh agent only your captures — not this file, not the code — and the five questions. Put its answers in the PR, unedited.

**The ways agents have fooled themselves on this project. Check each before you say done.**
- *Green test, nothing on screen.* The thing is defined in data and never appears in play. Go and find it in the running game.
- *Reachable only by a flag, a debug spawn or a test fixture.* A player cannot get there. It is not built.
- *Decoration without behaviour.* A lit window nobody is behind. A crane that does not lift.
- *The working folder passes and the commit does not.* Commit exact paths, then check what you committed, not what is on disk.
- *A reference result edited to make a check pass.* Never.
- *"Done" on a partial.* Say what works, what does not, and what you could not look at.

**How to use this card.** Bold names are fixed so the world stays consistent; everything else is yours to invent — decide, build, look. If an existing character already fills a face's role, keep their name and give them this want and this line. If an idea here plays badly, replace it with something that fills the same line of the Town Recipe and say so in the PR. **This PR is ready when Slice 1 passes the Stranger Test.** The brief's remaining jobs follow in a second PR on the same place.

**Direct execution commission · Sector completion**  
**Native parents:** `W2`, `W3`, `W4`, `LW-13`  
**Source-review baseline:** `f95de0eb1ba7560839209936afba48c7b96fe41a` · 2026-11-08  
**Commission status:** authored; current gameplay must be inspected, not presumed complete or absent.  
**Existing identity:** `sector_sedna_dark`  

This is a complete, standalone assignment for an implementation agent with the repository. Its EC label is a document address, not a new task queue or runtime identifier. Read current native authority and reconcile changed source before acting. New scene treatments and numerical composition bands are design proposals commissioned by the owner; existing IDs and inherited opportunity obligations remain authoritative unless deliberately migrated.

## The place you are making

The post has enough light to repair a hull and enough honesty to say what it cannot do. Beyond it, the dark rim holds wrecks and a tanker rumor. Sedna should create the satisfaction of a prepared expedition, an earned recovery and a person worth returning to—not the irritation of discovering a missing service only after it is too late.

## Bounded scope and initial composition targets

Own the whole playable sector experience, using **Sedna Survey Post** as the center of composition rather than deleting the rest of the sector. Complete **1 headline job(s), 3 smaller opportunities, 2 purposeful routine loops, and 3 recurring social/occupational roles** described below. Roles may share native actors; this is not an additive actor-spawn quota. Existing compatible content counts when it genuinely satisfies the outcome; do not create duplicate jobs merely to reach a number.

Start from **2–3 intentional pockets**, approximately **2–4 S** across the local authored experience. Measure S at the default gameplay camera before using it; retain the sector's existing larger geography. Aim for **45–120 seconds of deliberate quiet between meaningful observations** between useful observations/actions along the intended local route. A headline job's first complete approach may occupy roughly **8–15 minutes**; small opportunities generally occupy 20–120 seconds. These are **proposed pacing/composition bands, not measured current values, forced timers, required runtime clocks or rigid acceptance thresholds**. Adjust with evidence when the result plays better. Sparse does not mean unfinished. Quiet carries a visible destination, a reason to wait and a way back.

Show at least one routine's actual source, work and destination on an ordinary visit. Different visits may expose different phases; no quest acceptance is required to start local life. Use native simulation/actor budgets, not every role and event simultaneously. The numbers define authored coverage, while production must measure and bound actual concurrent load. No more than one incident may demand urgent attention at a time.

## Spatial construction and navigation

Create a compact occupied survey/repair frontage, an outward observation bearing, a recoverable wreck pocket and an unambiguous return/departure reference. Preserve the no-refuel service identity. Do not add a secret generic fuel vendor. Required routes must be supportable by the native travel/recovery system with clear preflight constraints; optional deep excursions can be risky when the terms are visible.

## Residents and institutional character

- Dustwife Senna’s names/unique-wreck memory and The Question’s supported item interactions remain under existing contact gates.
- A survey/repair worker has an attended practical routine at the post.
- A tanker, when present under native rules, is a real limited actor and not guaranteed rescue summoned by a menu.

## Ordinary life, even without an accepted mission

- A worker repairs an actual received hull or instrument using available stock.
- A survey actor tends a known observation position and returns to the same berth.

## Headline jobs — complete playable sequences

### 1. Enough to Get Back

**Binding:** `PROPOSED-SEDNA-01`. This is a proposed commissioning slot, not a new runtime ID. Bind the closest existing suitable encounter before authoring anything new.

Upgrade an existing unique-wreck/recovery lead. Present the expedition’s service limits before departure. Recover an authentic named object, witness or component from the rim using an available fit and a planned return. A disabled vehicle or changed hazard allows a choice between cargo, rescue and a later recovery—not an unannounced permanent failure. Return to the canonical contact with the actual item/result; their memory advances only on the rightful event. Keeping the recovered capability should expand later options rather than require a reset.

## Smaller opportunities and return reasons

- Restore a survey beacon that provides a practical route reference.
- Deliver finite repair stock and watch a specific service resume.
- A conversation recognizes the names or held evidence the player genuinely accumulated.

## Light, material, motion and sound

Darkness supports a clear hierarchy: ship, obstacle, safe reference, inhabited post. It must not erase depth or require maximum monitor brightness. Warm repair light becomes emotionally meaningful because it is also useful. Preserve silence between local work sounds.

## Continuing value and visible consequences

A supplied remote post can become a reliable repair/research stop without contradicting its no-refuel identity. The player’s wider logistics/recovery network is what extends reach. No offscreen offline punishment should destroy that investment.

## Connections beyond this sector

These are proposed causal relationships to realize through existing topology and owners, not new jump links or proof that the shipment already exists.

- Eunomia provides continuity for named salvage.
- Phoebe can be a return refuge where actual topology permits.
- The global strategic network supplies reach without inventing local services.

## Reuse and deduplication anchors

Inspect these live paths first; their presence does not establish player-route acceptance. The paths are starting points, not blanket write reservations.

- `src/data/sectorWayOfLife.js`
- `src/ui/station/barContacts.js`
- `src/systems/stationContacts.js`
- `src/systems/survivorPod.js`
- `src/world/worldRecords.js`

## Questions you must answer by inspecting and playing

These questions are your design/research work, not a questionnaire to send back to the owner.

1. From the ordinary arrival, which promised places, people and activities actually appear, at what scale, and how does a stranger find the first useful action? Which apparent absence is a broken connection rather than missing content?
2. What is the smallest spatial arrangement that lets the place's work be understood and physically interrupted? Where are the approach, destination, alternate path and retreat, including a large legal hull and its load?
3. Which existing encounter/contact/asset already serves each named obligation? Which needs expansion, which should be merged into the same story, and which genuinely requires new production?
4. What currently makes interaction unpleasant: camera motion, invisible collision, weak lighting, poor targeting, instructions, latency, missing audio, an unclear outcome, or a dead return path? Reproduce the cause before choosing a remedy.
5. What happens when the player ignores the quest, helps before accepting it, moves the object, fails, leaves, saves, returns, changes ship, or approaches with no sound? What state survives, who owns it, and how does the player perceive it?
6. After all enumerated pieces work, what still makes the area feel like a demonstration rather than a place? Make the highest-impact composition and interaction corrections inside this scope. Do not answer thinness by multiplying decorative entities.

## Area-wide construction and acceptance standard

**Spatial design.** Measure one default gameplay-screen width in world units, denoted S, and the reference starter/tug/large-hull envelopes before placing geometry. Use the travel-time and screen-space bands in this brief as first-pass composition targets, then tune by playing. Keep existing sector IDs, coordinate frames, saved sites, gates and required routes. A district is a composition within the current sector, not a replacement map. Its entrance, center, working edge, refuge and departure must be intelligible without its nameplate. Functional geometry needs believable clearance, a reverse path, and honest collision; an enormous bounding sphere is not an interior.

**Density is an experience, not a spawn count.** Quiet, working and hub profiles intentionally differ. In a working neighborhood, a normal 60–90-second approach should reveal work in progress, a reachable person or service, and an optional intervention, without obliging the player to accept a quest. More than one of these can be the same well-composed event. Along connective travel, let the player see a destination before the current activity exhausts itself. Preserve deliberate silence at the frontier. At most one urgent local incident should seize attention; other routines can remain calm. Do not place an event every fixed number of seconds or create artificial interruptions while someone is reading.

**People have addresses.** Give recurring residents a physically recognizable berth, ship, machine or inhabited threshold; attach their canonical identity to it. Hailing/approaching uses a discoverable contextual action, a concise voice, and optional further conversation through existing contact UI. Make available work, active work and ready-to-return outcomes distinguishable by icon shape plus text/accessibility treatment, not color alone. Only eligible offers receive markers; resolved markers disappear; moved actors remain findable. Dialogue can be optional, but an actor must have a job, an attitude and an observable response. Do not clone a bar contact into an unrelated in-world person or create a generic exclamation-mark carpet.

**Required event depth.** For each headline sequence implement: discoverable setup; an understandable physical or strategic problem; at least two materially different approaches; a complication caused by an actual state change; a playable climax; settlement through the existing owner; and persistent return/recovery. Extra dialogue choices that trigger the same operation are not different approaches. Smaller opportunities may be brief, but must still connect to real work and a visible result. Existing equivalents can satisfy a slot when they meet its promise; upgrade them rather than adding duplicates. These are floors for completeness, not encouragement to pad the map with weak missions.

**World state must be seen.** Every major local consequence changes at least one physical or operational fact—an open berth, a repaired device, a supply queue, a resident's location, a patrol route, an infected surface—and, where relevant, one economic/social fact. Both come from committed state. Leaving, saving, continuing and returning must preserve the same causal result. Do not award a clean service visually while the cargo owner rejected delivery. Failure should create a recoverable problem or honest alternative where possible, not an unannounced permanent loss of the entire area's usefulness.

**A finite acceptance boundary.** Close the commission only when all named headline slots, all explicitly inherited LW opportunities, the specified ordinary routines, usable services/contacts, return states and required connections are working on ordinary routes. No known crash, save corruption, progression softlock, inaccessible required interaction, misleading consequence or materially broken camera/control remains within the scope. Count coverage by outcomes, not lines of code. Attractive optional extras may remain for a later PR; unexplained omissions of promised behavior may not.

**Judge the experience, not just the checklist.** A reviewer playing without this brief must be able to explain what this place is for, who is here, what can be done now, what changed after their action, and why they might return. They must point to screen-visible evidence, not quote the implementation. A place with the right objects but no readable routes, no convincing light, dead conversations or dull interaction fails even if its logic tests pass. Obtain a combined independent product/engineering critique where available. A specific subjective defect is actionable: “the service court reads as an empty parking lot” demands composition and activity, not a documentation fix. Do not claim perfection or stop on an unexplained score.

**Exercise the real negative paths.** Cover first visit without an accepted quest; the intended mission route; a plausible alternative; interruption/rejection; departure and return; save/Continue; and the representative small and large hull/load. Test destroyed or unavailable actors, duplicate settlement, nonzero origins, remapped input, muted audio and reduced motion where relevant. Targeted fixtures can reach rare states quickly but do not replace the ordinary approach. Inspect real rendered captures for appearance and motion for camera/handling claims. When the current environment cannot run the required route, preserve useful implementation and label route/visual acceptance UNVERIFIED—never silently downgrade it to source inspection.


## Sector-specific acceptance scenarios

- The ordinary player can read service/travel limits before committing.
- Named-wreck/contact counters do not advance from cosmetic discovery alone.
- Recovery cannot strand a required campaign indefinitely or reset acquired options.

## Explicitly reject

Blackness passed off as lighting; hidden fuel traps; a compulsory new-class build; magical tanker appearances; a generic shop that erases the frontier premise.

## Commission execution supplement — branch and proof

**Implementation belongs on this existing draft PR head** `experience-commissions/EC-S24-sedna-dark`. It already contains your complete commission. Do not create a second planning PR; contribute actual source, integrated assets, route evidence and iterative repairs on this branch. Before modifying files, compare latest master, current open implementation PRs, active Finish lanes and `NOW.md` exact-path claims. Keep native one-writer authority intact; merge new upstream changes through repository-approved procedure.

**Professional scene authoring:** Build a sector with a recognizable purpose, navigable approaches, purposeful inhabitants who can be found and interacted with, work that happens without a quest, and choices that leave physical and operational consequences. Compare two or three feasible approaches to the most deficient named scene and execute the best option for **clarity, agency, distinctive atmosphere and cost**; be skeptical of filler actors, decorative orbit, copy-paste mission generators and flat repainting.

**Quality and performance proof:** Observe the normal arrival, a live routine, mission alternative, interruption/recovery and return after Continue. Check visual composition and actual motion at normal zoom; confirm controls, muted audio and reduced-motion alternatives. Measure busy-scene worker step, presentation, CPU, GPU, shader/asset admission and memory before/after where relevant. Do not manufacture more actors than native budgets can support, introduce always-awake decorative physics or pixelate away performance. Shared contacts, economy, world records and traffic use their canonical writers.

**Finite stop:** Preserve all explicitly inherited jobs and local opportunities. The sector remains **AREA INCOMPLETE** until every named outcome is verified in the actual game, including negative cases and return. Apply the current native reviewer policy, including three independent reviewers where mandated. An interrupted session reports commit, exact player route/seed, completed production outcomes, absent evidence and next concrete action—not a falsely completed commission.

## Execution contract — own the experience, not just the files

You are the implementation lead for the named commission. Produce working gameplay source/assets and commit them on this assigned draft PR branch; create a linked PR only when a canonical shared owner requires a separate change. This is an execution assignment, not a request for another plan, prompt, simulation transcript, catalog, or test-only demonstration. Your responsibility includes design judgment, source integration, presentation, failure recovery, and the ordinary player route. A subordinate's completed component does not discharge your responsibility for the whole.

**Establish truth before replacing things.** Read the current `AGENTS.md`, relevant nested instructions, `design/VISION.md`, the applicable parts of `design/GDD_2_0.md`, and the current master-plan campaign/lane/status. Inspect `git status --short`, exact relevant diffs, open PRs and `design/program/NOW.md`. Read the named native parents in this commission. Inspect the existing route in the running game; trace its source owners. Classify each promised outcome as working, present-but-poor, disconnected, absent, blocked by a shared defect, or unverified. A prose claim, a shipped catalog row, and a passing unit test are not equivalent to a working experience. Preserve the good parts and finish their missing connections.

**Do not start a competing backlog.** The EC-S/EC-G/EC-A/EC-Z/EC-C labels in this document are commission labels, not new queue IDs. `build_map.md` is specification/history with dispatch closed; current master lanes govern execution. `INFERENCE_LANES.md` §0.2 explicitly supports area development. Absorb related `INFERENCE_IDEAS.md` leaves into this outcome; do not count them as unrelated extra accomplishments. Check `build_map_done.md` and live code before rebuilding a shipped feature. Record authoritative status in the existing campaign/lane context. The attached manifest and reconciliation tool are read-only aids, not a second scheduler.

**Make implementation decisions rather than requesting taste decisions from the owner.** Compare two or three credible ways to solve each important missing connection. Select the simplest complete result that preserves the intended feeling and offers useful play. Explain substantial departures briefly in the PR. The arrival treatment, causal outcomes and rejection examples are commitments; incidental set dressing, exact dimensions, incidental dialogue and staging are design variables. Do not preserve a bad parameter merely because it is already in code. Conversely, do not rewrite a sound architecture to make your contribution look larger.

**Work in an integrated loop.** Inspect the public route → identify the most consequential missing/broken experience → implement it through canonical owners → exercise it in the real scene → inspect the resulting image, motion, sound and interaction → fix the material failures → continue through the remaining named scope. Begin actual production once enough is known to make a responsible edit. If research has stopped changing the design decision, stop researching and build. Do not substitute a month of harness construction for one finished encounter.

**Use specialists when available.** Delegate meaningful, disjoint work: spatial composition/assets, gameplay and continuity, interaction/audio, and independent product/engineering critique. Give each specialist an exact deliverable, current source base, read dependencies, reserved write paths and a merge/interface contract. Retain integration ownership yourself. A single-agent environment performs these roles sequentially; do not claim independent review when the same agent merely changed hats. Review the integrated result at a meaningful boundary, not every tiny edit. Follow current repository batch-verification rules rather than inventing screenshot or reviewer quotas.

**Shared code is not owned by geography.** Twenty sector agents must not each replace `world.js`, the camera, the contact renderer or the mission engine. Claim exact current paths, place local composition/behavior in the appropriate existing extension seams, and coordinate a narrowly specified shared fix with its owner. Define the consumer contract and complete other independent work while waiting. A blocked shared fix leaves the affected acceptance claim open; it does not justify stubs or stop unrelated authorized work. Keep concurrent foreign edits; no reset, clean, stash, force-push, broad staging, or unapproved extra worktree. Integrate remote changes by the repository's current permitted workflow.

**One truth for every consequence.** Physics, cargo, economy, missions, law, world records, progression, saves and presentation retain their canonical writers. Send intents and consume committed results. Visuals and dialogue must not invent success, a payment, a death, an infection, a delivered shipment or ownership. Use stable IDs plus generation checks where transient entity IDs can be reused. Use seeded RNG and simulation time, not wall-clock timers or ambient randomness. Do not create a parallel infection ledger, quest database, faction reputation calculator, or private credit balance.

**The current owner's boundaries are part of the design.** Remain ship-scale; this commission does not add an on-foot game. No enemies constructing new structures during combat. Preserve acquired Adventure options: meaningful consequences may change a place, but routine fitting, alliance repair and business recovery must not require a fresh character or forced prestige reset. Swarm is an exuberant combat expression of shared mechanics, not a second incompatible physics game. Ship fittings must change usable capabilities and their presentation, not just numerical labels. Do not manufacture extra complexity as a substitute for finishing ordinary interactions.

**Use the actual asset pipeline.** Check existing shipped and unintegrated assets before authoring replacements. Reuse is not a creative ceiling: produce missing structure, motion, material or audio when the experience needs it, using the current Forge/release workflow and coordinated manifest ownership. Temporary blockouts are useful during development but cannot pass visual acceptance. Never count a turntable, a promotional image, a hidden flag or a debug spawn as the normal game.

**Measure budgets without sacrificing the promise.** Numbers of opportunities and routine roles below are authored coverage, not permission to keep every actor, rigid body, light and effect active. Respect native global budgets; reuse crews between phases; use existing far-state/persistence mechanisms and bounded pools. Measure representative crowded routes, not empty scenes. Do not lower resolution, erase atmosphere, alter physical outcomes or disable necessary behavior to conceal an unprofiled bottleneck. Claims about the owner's device require measurements on that device; software rendering is not hardware-performance evidence.

**Publish honestly.** Keep one focused outcome PR, or a clearly linked dependent stack when shared changes require it. Never put unrelated work into a convenient UI PR or bypass approval requirements. No merge or deployment unless separately authorized. Report the commit, changed production paths, ordinary entry route, what the player can now do, evidence actually obtained, and precisely what remains. A session interruption is a checkpoint, not completion: preserve the next concrete action and unresolved findings in the existing owner context. Continue eligible work while execution remains available; do not stop just because one test or one local story passed.

## Completion decision and PR handoff

Close this commission only after its full named production scope works together on the ordinary route, the local acceptance scenarios pass, required assets/presentation are integrated, and no known material defect invalidates its promise. The relevant current repository quality and performance gates still apply. A successful fixture, one finished mission, or one attractive screenshot cannot close the area. Small unrelated defects may be handed to their existing owners; a missing central interaction, repeated loss of control, false consequence, broken Continue or unreadable place may not.

Use professional judgment for the final experience review: can a player understand the situation, choose a useful action, feel its result, recover from a mistake, and want to return? Ask the reviewer for concrete failures in the actual scene, not a ceremonial word such as “optimal.” An unexplained score is not acceptance. If a material complaint remains, fix it and review the changed boundary; do not repeat unchanged tests for reassurance.

The PR description must name the ordinary route, before/after player outcome, native parent coverage, inherited opportunities completed, source/assets changed, checks actually run, visual/motion/audio evidence actually inspected, and remaining limitations. Reconcile relevant existing INFERENCE leaves individually without declaring unrelated rows complete. Preserve current native status and path ownership. Keep implementation readiness separate from route/visual/hardware acceptance when the environment cannot establish all of them. When a real session limit intervenes, leave a resumable checkpoint and keep the commission open; do not relabel partial scope as a successful smaller assignment.
